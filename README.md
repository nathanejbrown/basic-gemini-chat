# Basic chat application connected to Google Gemini

### Project set up

First run `npm i` followed by `node app/main.js`. The application will ask you for a prompt, which is sent to Gemini upon hitting the enter key. Once the response is complete, it will prompt again. Type "exit" as your prompt to close the connection.
